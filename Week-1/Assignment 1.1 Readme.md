A - What is the main functionality of the browser?
    The main functionality of a web browser is to read data from a server that is connected to the internet and translates it into images and text.
    This data is enclosed in Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) and a browser interprets this code to create what we experience through text, sounds,
