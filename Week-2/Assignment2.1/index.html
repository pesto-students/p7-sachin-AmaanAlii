          <h2>Why is well-being useful for public health?</h2>
          Well-being is associated with numerous health-, job-, family-, and
          economically-related benefits. For example, higher levels of
          well-being are associated with decreased risk of disease, illness, and
          injury; better immune functioning; speedier recovery; and increased
          longevity.Individuals with high levels of well-being are more
          productive at work and are more likely to contribute to their
          communities.

          <h2>How does well-being relate to health promotion?</h2>
          Health is more than the absence of disease; it is a resource that
          allows people to realize their aspirations, satisfy their needs and to
          cope with the environment in order to live a long, productive, and
          fruitful life. In this sense, health enables social, economic and
          personal development fundamental to well-being.

          <h2>How is well-being defined?</h2>
          There is no consensus around a single definition of well-being, but
          there is general agreement that at minimum, well-being includes the
          presence of positive emotions and moods (e.g., contentment,
          happiness), the absence of negative emotions (e.g., depression,
          anxiety), satisfaction with life, fulfillment and positive
          functioning.
